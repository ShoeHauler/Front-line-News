        "content": "Despite the intensifying of attacks on the North-Eastern Ukranian city of Kharkiv by Russia, Some residents on Ukraine's now front-line town are refusing to evacuate. \n \n On May 10th, Russia began a new offensive in the North of Ukraine, with what appears to be an attempt to take Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv. Although, Russian troops have not reached the city yet, they have made gains since the start of the new offensive by controlling a confirmed 173.36 km² of land in the North and have recently begun shelling the city. \n \n The Kyiv Independent has reported that some residents are refusing to evacuate the city, despite the danger, as they have adopted this war time environment into their way of life. One person reported asking a friend who is a resident of Kharkiv why they haven't left yet, to which they responded that 'I sowed the garden, but I'm in trouble, a rocket fell on the garden. So now I don't sow half the garden because the rocket is sticking out of the ground and it hasn't been neutralized yet. So I don't go close, but sow everything in front of the rocket'. 'That's how they live', the lady told The Counteroffensive, with a smile on her face. \n \n According to the head of the Bilopillia community, Yurii Zarko, it's mostly the elderly who are refusing to leave the city. They often argue that they were born here, this is their land their parents and grandparents lived here, and so they will die here. Some people are also used to living off their farmland and don't want to try living elsewhere, the Kyiv Independent stated."

Reuters stated. \n \n Front-line news also understands that Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State has stated that U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia that were attacking the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Blinked stated that: \n \n 'Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine. And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose'. \n \n This new policy will allow Ukranian military personnel to fire artillery and short-range rockets from HIMARS rocket launchers against command posts, arms depots, and other assets in Russian territory that are being used by Russian forces to carry out attacks on Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. \n \n However, this does not grant Ukraine permission to fire longer-range ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles inside of Russia."
